# salesforce-auth

Collection of Salesforce authentication flows for API-based integrations. Can be used as an imported 'config' file.

Supports the username/password flow and the JWT flow (requires you to provide a 'private_key.pem' file in the directory).

This script also provides an easy way to prep the headers of an API request or return a simple-salesforce client.
